# **How To Plan A Project**

Before writing a single line of code we need to **plan** the project. Planning phase is for for **reference** so we always have something to adhere to and checking whether feature is being **implemented** correctly.

## **Planning**

1. **User Stories** - High level overview of an application from **user's perspective**. All user stories put together will define the **functionality of entire app**.
2. **Feature** - These are things that are required to implement user stories from **developer's perspective**. 
3. **Flowchart** - In order to **visualize** and keep track of user interactions.
4. **Architecture** - How will we **organize** our code and what **Javascript** features we will use. **Structure** in which we implement the application's functionality.

Above mentioned steps are the planning step and after we have planned the project we move on to development step.

## **User Story**

## **FEATURES**

By using stories we can create a **list of features** required for implementing those stories.

## **Flowchart**

It is recommended to start the flow chart with an **event**. **Page loading** happens first so we can use that as a starting point.

1. Yellow -> actions/interactions
2. Green -> rendering on webpage
3. Red -> asynchronous operations
4. blue -> data storage/retrieval

We don't have to come up with a fully detailed flowchart right in the beginning  i.e **planning phase**, we can create a rough sketch and then continue to add on features as they come up.

This only tells us what our program what to do but not how to do it. That would be handled by **architecture**.

## **Architecture**

We can do it after some code has already been written and don't necessarily need to have it at beginning. Code could require re-factoring and architectural changes later on.
